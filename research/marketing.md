- ### Create unique, accurate page titles

  A `<title>` element tells both users and search engines what the topic of a particular page is. Place the `<title>` element within the `<head>` element of the HTML document, and create unique title text for each page on your site.

  - #### Create unique `<title>` elements for each page

  - #### Use brief, but descriptive `<title>` elements

- ### Use the meta description tag

  A page's meta description tag gives Google and other search engines a summary of what the page is about. A page's title may be a few words or a phrase, whereas a page's meta description tag might be a sentence or two or even a short paragraph. Like the `<title>` element, the meta description tag is placed within the `<head>` element of your HTML document.

  - #### Accurately summarize the page content

  - #### Use unique descriptions for each page

- ### Use heading tags to emphasize important text

  Use meaningful headings to indicate important topics, and help create a hierarchical structure for your content, making it easier for users to navigate through your document.

  - #### Use headings sparingly across the page
