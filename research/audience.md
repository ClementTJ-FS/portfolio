- ## Why identifying your target audience matters

  - **Who the people are**, you know how to get to them (the blogs they read, the sites they visit, the stuff they search in Google, etc.);
  - **How they describe the type of services you offer,** you can word the copy on your site to match the conversation in their head (very important!);
  - **How they choose and compare products** in your category, you know how to structure and prioritize content on your site;
  - **What they want,** your value proposition can state exactly that and the whole site can be 98% relevant to them;
  - **What they don’t care about,** you can dismiss and cut it from the site;
  - **How their life is better** thanks to your service, you know which end-benefits to communicate.
