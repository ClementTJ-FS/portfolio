- ## Why identifying your target audience matters

  - **Who the people are**, you know how to get to them (the blogs they read, the sites they visit, the stuff they search in Google, etc.);
  - **How they describe the type of services you offer,** you can word the copy on your site to match the conversation in their head (very important!);
  - **How they choose and compare products** in your category, you know how to structure and prioritize content on your site;
  - **What they want,** your value proposition can state exactly that and the whole site can be 98% relevant to them;
  - **What they don’t care about,** you can dismiss and cut it from the site;
  - **How their life is better** thanks to your service, you know which end-benefits to communicate.

  - **What kind of presentation would seem "right" to these particular people?**

    &

  - **Whose else might potentially buy your product or service?**

# [3 Strategies for Your Target Employers](http://www.leamcleod.com/3-strategies-for-your-target-employers/)

***“Stop Applying, Start Targeting.”\***

- ## Applying is a transaction.

  - Applying is filling out all the forms and sending your information into the black hole of the job application process, and most likely, “never hearing back.”
  - Applying gives you very little control and even less leverage in your job search.

- ## Targeting is a strategy.

  - Targeting means you’ve identified who you are, [what you’re good at](https://www.leamcleod.com/how-to-brag-about-yourself-to-employers/), what kind of problems you can solve for what kind of employers who need the help you have to offer.
  - Then, you’ve identified where those employers are in the universe and you go after them.

- ## Targeting gives you far more control in your job search.

  - It gives you a much more structured approach to finding your dream job.
  - It allows you to get into the talent funnel before job requisitions are actually posted. 

- ## You’ve targeted. Now what?

  - Your goal is to start making contacts in the target organization and build relationships there. In the process, learn everything you can about the employer. Figure out what business problems they have that you can help solve.
  - Hiring managers have a "list". **Your mission is to get on that list for an ideal employer.**

- ## 3 Actions Once You’ve Targeted Employers

  ### 1. Connect with people inside your target employer organizations.

  ### 2. Request informational interviews with those people.

  ### 3. Leverage Social Media.
