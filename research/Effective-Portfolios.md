# [10 Characteristics of Excellent Portfolio Sites](http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2008/12/10-characteristics-of-excellent-portfolio-sites/)

1. ## Clear Communication

   - A portfolio site should **clearly and concisely** communicate with visitors about the services that are provided and what the designer has to offer to potential clients.
   - **The purpose of a portfolio site is to show the work of the designer and to attract new clients**.

2. ## Personality

   - Clients want to work with **someone that they like** and someone that will give them a good overall experience.

3. ## Creative

   - Portfolio sites often feature some of the most creative designs.
   - Design is **an artistic and creative profession**.

4. ## Lack of Excess

   -  **Getting rid of any excess** will help the existing information to stand out more and to be easily understood.

   -  Some of the most elegant and highly-respected portfolio sites are very **minimal** in their approach.
   -  Listing of services, description of qualifications, showcase of past work, and a means of contact.

5. ## Examples of Past Work

   - The **quality** of work in your portfolio is a major factor on the success of the portfolio site, but **presentation** can also make a big difference. In some cases designers display their work in a creative or impressive way that almost overshadows the work itself.

6. ## Shows the Best Work

   - Not every design you’ve ever done needs to be included in your portfolio.
   -  It’s better to only showcase specific examples rather than everything.
   - **it’s good to have a few high-quality examples to show for each category rather than having one big collection of all of your work**.

7. ## Call to Action

   - Since the ultimate purpose of the online portfolio is to attract new customers, it only **makes sense to ask** visitors for their business. 

8. ## Ease of Contact

   - The contact information should be easily found and accessed from any page.
   -  If too much information is requested or required, some contacts may be lost.

9. ## Visibility

   - A portfolio site can do everything right and have incredible work to display, but **if no one sees it**, it will do no good.
   - In order for the site to be effective it needs to be visible.
   - [The CSS Gallery List](http://www.thecssgallerylist.com/).
   - **Blogs are great for drawing traffic, building links, demonstrating expertise, and encouraging repeat visits**.
   - In addition to just helping your portfolio site to be more visible, blogs also help to show your personality to visitors.

10. ## Valid Code

    - **A portfolio site that has all kinds of validation errors sends the wrong message to visitors.**
