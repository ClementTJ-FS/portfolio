# Portfolio Plan

TJ Clement

---

## Audience -

I plan on targeting medium/larger sized companies with my portfolio. I would ideally like to get hired to a fortune 500 company.

## Look & Feel -

Taking my target audience into account, my portfolio will look clean and professional. There will not be any excess graphics or any jarring colors/animations.

I plan on keeping things as readable and easy to access as possible. This means having a minimal amount of layers and standard navigation.
